### Research Projects
- **Measurement of TL of the dash panel on FAW/Minan auto (2018.07~2018.08)** \
Based on the reverberation room - anechoic chamber method to quantify the sound insulation of the sound insulation mat, then we guide the sound absorption and lightweight performance improvement development.

- **Research on Sound Source Identification Technology of Reducer Based on Microphone Array (2017.12~2019.12)** \
Using the designed loop microphone array to measure the noise source signal of the reducer, the beamforming and NAH algorithms are used to identify and locate the noise source, which provides a basis for the subsequent noise reduction measures of the reducer.


- **The 9th National College Student Innovation Training Program (2015.06~2016.07)** \
"ABS System in the Application of Formula Student Racing", a suitable ABS system is designed according to the parameters of the Formula Student racing car. The control strategy includes PID control and threshold control.


### Scholarship & Awards
- Academic Scholarship, **Grade A** (3.times) (2017~2019)
- Outstanding student comprehensive scholarship (2016) 

### Experience & Activities
- 2019.03-2019.05    Teaching Assistant of the course Vehicle Theory.
