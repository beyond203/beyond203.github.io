Robust Reconstruction Based on Equivalent Source Method V1.0.(registration number:
2019SR0632905)
Research Projects
1 Measurement of TL of the dash panel on FAW/Minan auto (2018.07~2018.08)
Based on the reverberation room - anechoic chamber method to quantify the sound insulation of the
sound insulation mat, then we guide the sound absorption and lightweight performance improvement
development.
2 Research on Sound Source Identification Technology of Reducer Based on Microphone Array
(2017.12~2019.12)
Using the designed loop microphone array to measure the noise source signal of the reducer, the
beamforming and  NAH algorithms are used to identify and locate the noise source, which provides a
basis for the subsequent noise reduction measures of the reducer.
3 The 9th National College Student Innovation Training Program (2015.06~2016.07)
"ABS System in the Application of Formula Student Racing", a suitable ABS system is designed
according to the parameters of the Formula Student racing car. The control strategy includes PID control
and threshold control.
